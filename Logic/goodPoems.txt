-------------------------------------------------

Let us divided live, and our dear
Love to call even those lofty bards here.
By the grave, when I was false of heart, mine
eye awake, mine own true love may still shine.

Shall I know not what kept me guarded close, while yet
A little you see his active child do
Deeds of youth, so I sat and did beget
A world of the states with veins full of dew.


Shall I taste at first more strong to love, I and my
loud crying still two loves, there is no need.
O! what a task is thine, the future I
Believe in you. I am to be a weed.


Shall I fall down and shall be a cause, but my words,
Every one, to his stature, because
I go near and art to be cleansed. Two birds
And cedar wood and hewed stones sawed with saws.

Let us divided live, and our dear love. I'm
Going away; I know not but the time.
Don't hold my arm, I say,
You look in your decay,
With of nettle; this is my verse and rhyme.


A Limerick:
-----------
Shall I live, supposing thou art much too fair, to sing,
To rest; life's billows will be a king.
Wild nights were I with thee,
To stay where thou shalt be,
At that, I was sheltered from a spring.
